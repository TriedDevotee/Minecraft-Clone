# Minecraft-Clone
I wrote a clone of the popular sandbox game minecraft using the original libraries. It is written in java with the LWJGL and OpenGL libraries for texture rendering. I used ChatGPT for some basic debugging and planning as I've never used these libraries before. Full credit to Mojang, Microsoft for the idea and textures.

Fair warning - 
I have never written something of this size. My code is all over the place and I know it. Also, my sheep rendering is broken - it doesn't work. I may fix this if I can be assed but idk.

Also, I'm not sure if I need permission to use Minecrafts actual textures. If I do then I am happy to take this down - it was more of a project anyway

This took me 5 days. Of my life. T_T
