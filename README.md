# Minecraft-Clone
I wrote a clone of the popular sandbox game minecraft using the original libraries. It is written in java with the LWJGL and OpenGL libraries for texture rendering. I used ChatGPT for some basic debugging and planning as I've never used these libraries before. Full credit to Mojang, Microsoft for the idea and textures.
